      title: "Initial Concept",
      date: "Day 1",
      image: "/images/0-initial.png", 
      description: "Our journey began with a feature-rich but overwhelmingly complex interface. As seen in the image, the initial design displayed all cephalometric landmarks and measurements simultaneously â€” green landmarks, blue tracing outlines, and red measurement lines all competed for attention. Direct numerical values were scattered across the radiograph itself, making it difficult to focus on specific areas of interest. While technically impressive, the interface posed significant cognitive challenges for clinical users.",
      uiChanges: [
        "All landmarks displayed simultaneously (green dots)",
        "Measurement lines overlaid directly on image (red lines)",
        "Anatomical outline tracings shown at all times (blue lines)",
        "Numerical values scattered across radiograph image",
        "High information density with no visual hierarchy"

      title: "First Iteration",
      date: "Day 2",
      image: "/images/1-step.png",
      description: "Our first major redesign, as shown in this screenshot, focused on establishing a clean slate by temporarily removing all visual noise. We created a minimalist interface with a clear separation between the radiograph view and control panels. The sidebar was redesigned to provide structured access to tools without overwhelming users with options. Notice how the interface now features substantial negative space, providing visual breathing room lacking in our initial version. This foundation allowed us to thoughtfully reintroduce only the most essential elements in subsequent iterations.",

      description: "In this iteration, we began thoughtfully reintroducing essential functionality within our simplified framework. As shown in the screenshot, we implemented a tabbed interface with clear visual distinction between different measurement types (skeletal vs. dental). The right panel now features a structured, data-oriented presentation of cephalometric measurements with clear indication of normal ranges. Note how spacing, alignment, and data presentation all work together to create a clean reading experience without the visual overload of the original design.",

      description: "This iteration introduced our breakthrough readability enhancements, visible in the screenshot through the clear tabular analysis results with proper spacing and visual hierarchy. The critical improvement was our high-contrast color system with carefully calibrated values for different measurement types. We used green for measurements within normal range and red for outliers, with precise numerical display of standard deviations. The interface now included an expandable analysis panel and clear organization of Ricketts Analysis metrics into logical measurement groupings.",

The interface now showcases a comprehensive yet clean analysis view with intuitive landmarks on the radiograph image. The right panel organizes all measurements with clinical context and normal ranges, using visual emphasis to immediately highlight areas of concern. The key achievement is our visual prioritization system that immediately draws the clinician's attention to the most significant deviations while maintaining access to comprehensive data.
